# S.A.F.E.R.
### Smart Automated Fire Emergency Responder

S.A.F.E.R. is a compact fire-prevention robot designed to detect early signs of fire and automatically respond to stop small fires from growing. It uses flame recognition, smoke sensing, and a fast water-spray system to provide quick and effective fire suppression.

## 🔥 Features

### • Sweeping Motion Fire Detection
Uses a rotating sensor system along with a flicker-detection algorithm to distinguish real fire from ambient light.

### • Smoke Detection
Monitors airborne particles to detect early fire conditions even before visible flames appear.

### • Fast-Acting Water Spray System
Activates automatically when fire or smoke is detected. Designed for rapid suppression to reduce potential damage.
